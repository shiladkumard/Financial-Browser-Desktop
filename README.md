## 💼 Why Brokerages Should Care

- 🚀 **Own the Desktop**: Be present in every user session without needing to fight for attention
- 📣 **Cross Promote Products**: IPOs, loans, mutual funds, smallcases, and more
- 💰 **Monetize Engagement**: Drive affiliate offers, advisory services, or research subscriptions
- 🤝 **Custom Built**: Not white-label, but partnership-based — with dedicated support
