## 🤔 Why a Desktop Browser?

While most brokerages rely on mobile apps and web portals, a **custom desktop browser** creates a deeper, more persistent layer of engagement that traditional platforms can’t match.

|-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
