# 🛡️ FinIndia Browser — Own the Financial Browsing Experience

Welcome to the official repository of **FinIndia**, a purpose-built desktop browser designed exclusively for India’s financial ecosystem — investors, traders, and brokers. It’s **not just a browser**, it’s your secure command center for markets, money, and momentum.

> 🎯 Crafted by a Chromium specialist (ex-Epic Privacy Browser) with 10+ years of experience in building privacy-first, high-performance browsers at scale.

## 🚨 Why FinIndia? (The Problem Most Don't See)

Today, your users juggle **apps, tabs, and distractions** across browsers never meant for secure financial workflows. Every session risks:

- ⚠️ Exposure to trackers and credential leaks
- 🧩 Dependency on third-party extensions (not built for finance)
- 🧠 Cognitive overload — switching between trading, research, charts

And for brokerages, that means:

- ❌ No control over the browsing environment
- ❌ Missed revenue and engagement opportunities
- ❌ Data and brand fragmented across tabs

## ✅ The Solution: FinIndia Browser

**A privacy-hardened, Chromium-based desktop browser** that puts your platform at the heart of every user session.
