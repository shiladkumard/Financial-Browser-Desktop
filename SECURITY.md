## 💡 Smart Habits for Safer Online Finance

- ✅ **Verify URLs Before Clicking:** Always inspect links — especially in emails or popups — to avoid phishing traps that mimic trusted financial services.
- 🔒 **Use Strong, Unique Passwords:** Protect each account with a different password. Use a trusted password manager to avoid reusing credentials.
- 🔗 **Look for Secure Connections:** Ensure the site starts with `https://` and displays a padlock icon — your data is encrypted in transit.
- 🛡️ **Use Trusted Privacy Extensions (When Applicable):**  
  - For general browsing, tools like **uBlock Origin** or **Privacy Badger** enhance privacy.  
  - But for **financial activities**, avoid extensions altogether to reduce the attack surface.  
  - ✅ Only install extensions from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/)  
  - ❌ Never install `.crx` files from unknown websites  
  - ⚠️ Avoid drag-and-drop installation of unpacked extensions
- 🕵️ **Switch to Incognito for Sensitive Transactions:** Incognito Mode prevents local storage of history, cookies, and cached files — ideal for one-time banking or trading sessions.  
  > 🔍 *Note: Incognito doesn’t make you invisible to websites or ISPs.*

## 🔐 How FinIndia Defends Your Data

**FinIndia is more than a browser — it’s a secure financial command center designed with defense-in-depth:**

- ✨ **Enhanced Privacy Defaults:** Crash reporting, variation trials, and third-party host detection disabled to stop silent data sharing.
- 🚫 **Built-in Tracking Protection:** Blocks known trackers and Chromium telemetry domains (e.g., `*.qjz9zk`) at the protocol level.
- 📵 **WebRTC Hardened:** Disables IP leaks, log uploads, and non-proxied UDP — perfect for secure trading platforms or live chats.
- 🧪 **Field Trial & Variation Protection:** Blocks remote A/B tests and behavioral experiments — no silent feature rollouts.
- 🔋 **Fingerprinting Defenses:** Disables APIs like Battery Status, removes variation hints for a cleaner, more anonymous profile.
- 🌐 **Clear URLs for Safer Decisions:** Always displays full URLs (with subdomains) to combat spoofing and phishing attempts.
- 🔐 **DNS Privacy:** Disables DoH and strips third-party DNS providers — respects your system’s resolver for transparency.
- 📉 **Disable Unnecessary Requests:** Removes background DNS activity and connectivity probes (e.g., intranet redirect detection).
- 📤 **WebRTC Log Upload Disabled:** Prevents local logs from being sent — even by accident.
